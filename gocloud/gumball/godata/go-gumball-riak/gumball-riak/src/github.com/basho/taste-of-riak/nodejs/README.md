Taste of Riak - NodeJS
======================

# Cluster Setup

When running these examples against a Riak `devrel`, you can use the following command to set up the cluster to use the `leveldb` backend by default:

```bash
./tools/devrel/setup-dev-cluster -b leveldb
```

Other arguments may be necessary depending on your Riak environment.
